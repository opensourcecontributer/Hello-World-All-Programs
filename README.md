# Hello World Programs in Multiple Languages

![Hacktoberfest](https://img.shields.io/badge/Hacktoberfest-2023-blueviolet)

A beginner-friendly repository to collect "Hello, World!" programs in as many programming languages as possible. This project is a celebration of programming and a great way for new developers to make their first open-source contribution.

## ðŸš€ What is This Project About?

The goal of this project is to create a large collection of `Hello, World!` programs. A "Hello, World!" is a simple program that outputs "Hello, World!" and is often the first program written when learning a new language.

## ðŸ¤” How to Contribute

Contributing to this project is simple! We welcome contributions from everyone. Hereâ€™s how you can help:

1.  **Fork the repository.**
2.  **Choose a programming language** that is not already in our collection.
3.  **Create a new folder** with the name of the language (e.g., `Python`, `JavaScript`). Please use PascalCase for folder names.
4.  Inside your new folder, create a file named `HelloWorld.[extension]` (e.g., `HelloWorld.py`, `HelloWorld.js`).
5.  **Add the "Hello, World!" code** for that language in your new file.
